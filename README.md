# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
This Flask-based face recognition attendance system automates attendance tracking using OpenCV, scikit-learn, and joblib. It detects faces in real-time, recognizes registered users, and logs attendance with timestamps. The system supports adding new users and retraining the model dynamically.
